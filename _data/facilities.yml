intro: "The scientific programme plans to show the participants a wide spectrum of high profile scientific and academic facilities present in Pisa and Florence:
<br>
  - The VIRGO site of the European Gravitational Observatory (EGO).
<br>
  - The Italy National Research Council (CNR).
<br>
  - The National Institute for Nuclear Physics (INFN)
<br>
  - The European Laboratory for Non-linear Spectroscopy (LENS)
<br>
  - The University of Pisa.
<br>
  - The University of Florence. 
<br>
<br>
Beside the visits there will be a large number of talks, as in the past editions. In particular we will have overview on all the major topics and experiments currently running in the above facilities and their implication, so to better appriciate the visits and understand the concepts from different points of view. It will be an undoubtedly rich experience."
